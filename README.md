TREND ANALYSIS IN ENEM TESTS: using NLP techniques to classify topics in Natural Sciences.

Currently, ENEM is the most popular exam for admission to Public and Private
Universities in Brazil. For this reason, it is essential to know what the most
frequent topics are each year, in order to help the study or search for teachers
and students who are interested in focusing their classes on the ENEM test. This
study aims to analyze trend topics in Natural Sciences through the study of
Natural Processing Language (NLP), using word embeddings with TF-IDF and
NMF. Furthermore, to classify topics within areas of knowledge, the most used
methods for this come from the scikit-learn library, such as Random Forest, SVM
and Naïve Bayes. This work aims to help students organize their studies focused
directly on the most frequent content of the ENEM tests.
